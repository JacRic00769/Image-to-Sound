# Image-to-Sound
This repository contains the code and documentation for a research project exploring the algorithmic transformation of image data into sound. Developed during an Independent Summer Research Grant, the project investigates how pixel information from static images can be translated into musical parameters such as pitch, rhythm, and timbre.
