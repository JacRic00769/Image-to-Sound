# Image-to-Sound: Algorithmic Music from Visual Data 🎼🖼️

This project explores the creative intersection of computer vision and music composition by converting image pixel data into algorithmically generated sound. Developed during an Independent Summer Research Grant in 2024, the goal was to translate raw visual information into meaningful sonic output using a combination of programming and audio tools.
